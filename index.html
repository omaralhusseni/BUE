                <p class="p-text">
                    I hope you find the information on the BUE Website helpful whether you are a registered student, a

                    BUE is a research-led university, where research plays an important role not only in the advancement of
                    knowledge, but also in solving relevant problems that face the Egyptian and international communities.<br><br>

                    BUE opened Postgraduate Programmes in: Engineering, Informatics and Business. The greatest and most
                    rewarding investment that parents can make is to provide their sons and daughters with the best possible
